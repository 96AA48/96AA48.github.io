  Ever since the first time I installed a Linux distro and started programming, I wanted to make something that people love to use and looks pretty while they're using it.<br>
  This has motivated me to make websites like [Werkmanrooster](http://werkmanrooster.nl/), a website that helps students find their schedule faster.<br>
  It always revolves around a few principles for me:


  * Making something I would use
  * Make it pretty
  * Learn something from the project

  And these principles have served me well, check out the portfolio section for more.
