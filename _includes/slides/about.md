### Hey there, my name is Bram!  

I'm a passionate web developer based in Groningen, The Netherlands.  
I make stuff with my keyboard such as websites, games as well as server- and client-side applications.  
I also spend time on Github doing open-source things.  
Check my portfolio section for more information.  
Thanks for visiting! - Bram
