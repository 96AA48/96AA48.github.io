Werkmanrooster or rooster.io is a small fullstack data-drive webapplication powered by Node.js to provide easier access to schedules for students. The idea started out small with a small crawler that went through the schedule site's pages and made a database of all of the students. It has now turned into a schedule search engine that was programmed with other schools in mind. It was constructed using Node.js, Express.js, Jade, LESS, MongoDB and Tor.
