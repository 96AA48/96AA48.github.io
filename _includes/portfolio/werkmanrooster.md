Werkmanrooster or rooster.io is a small fullstack data-driven webapplication powered by Node.js to provide easier access to schedules for students. The idea started out small with a small crawler that went through the schedule site's pages and made a database of all of the students. It has now turned into a schedule search engine that was programmed with other schools in mind. It was constructed using Node.js, Express.js, Jade, LESS, MongoDB and Tor.  

I've put 121 hours in the current version and put 500+ hours in an older legacy version. Making this one of biggest projects ever.
