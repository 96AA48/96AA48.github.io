Journally was created for my Linux workflow to have a prettified journalctl console on my desktop. It was made to be extensible and easy to configure.
With simple stuff like colors and seperators and ignore lists, it's easy to know what you're system is doing at all times.
Journally was built with Nodejs and is fully compatible with any journalctl system (Arch Linux, Ubuntu, etc) and support all journalctl commands.

View this application on [npm](http://npmjs.org/journally).
