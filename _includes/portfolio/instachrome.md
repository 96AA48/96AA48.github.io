Instachrome was a project to get a better graps of CSS3 filters and Chrome extensions. It's a small Chrome extension that adds CSS3 filters to your browser experience and even lets you take screenshots of your current page.  
Make your own filters with sliders such as sepia, blur, grayscale, saturation, brightness, hue rotation, invert, opacity and contrast.
