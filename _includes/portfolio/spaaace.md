Spàààce was a project I used to learn OpenFL, Haxe, HaxePunk and related languages and libraries. I used assets from Kenney and music from OpenGameArt to get started and built myself a game. The game is a simple space shooter developed for Android but can also run on Linux, Windows, iOS, Flash and HTML5.
