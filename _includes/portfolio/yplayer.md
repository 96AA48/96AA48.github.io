Yplayer was an experiment to see if I could write an entire CLI application on my Raspberry Pi with only Vim. It more or less taught me the essentials of Vim and how to use `child_process` in Node. It features the same design as gmplayer but this time with Youtube as a source. You can even download full videos and play them immediately via mplayer.

Check out the [npm](http://npmjs.org/yplayer) for more information.
