Bridge was a simple project to see if me and my girlfriend could create a game. She created the asset and I used Haxe with HaxePunk and OpenFL to turn into a multiplatform game. The game has been compiled for both Linux, Neko and HTML5 in the development process and even has a version [online](http://96aa48.github.io/bridge).

Check out the [Github](http://github.com/96aa48/bridge) for more information.
