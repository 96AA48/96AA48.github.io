gmplayer was a follow up to [yplayer](https://github.com/96aa48/yplayer.git) with the same concept. This application however downloads from Google Play Music instead of Youtube. You just need to fill out `~/.gmplayerrc` with your login information and you're set! Use the command to either download and play with mplayer, or use the `-d` switch to download only and use it for mpd or something along those lines. It also supports the writing of metadata to the downloaded mp3 files, so that your songs are neatly organized when you browse through your library with your favorite music player.  

View this application on [npm](http://npmjs.org/gmplayer).
