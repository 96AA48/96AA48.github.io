Dropzone was a small project I started with when I was on vacation in Austria. It was a simple solution to sharing files easily without uploading and using no third party. The result was a working version that can instantly share files with your friends online and even preview files and stream them to them without downloading.  
However, due to the limitations of many NAT related libraries I've halted the development Dropzone since it cannot automatically port forward itself.
