With all the hype around No Man's Sky, I decided to make a 2D version of the randomly generated universe game.
A project of that size needed a generator that would generate all of the galaxies, systems, planets and more.
So I looked around the internet for some abandoned projects and old code that I could blow the dust off of and re-purpose for my game.
Galaxygen is built using Nodejs and the work of leowald, tweaked and upgraded for my project.
