So here it is, my first "real" blog. I've had several small blogs already, but most of them on shitty `.tk` domains in order to be a real "webdeveloper" when I was 12. Things have changed since then, for the better (I hope). I've self studied my way into being a somewhat capable developer, using mostly Javascript and Node.js. Slowly moving towards using Unity3D and other platforms/frameworks. Sometimes even trying new languages or things along those lines.

Enough small talk. This blog is made to write some articles about random stuff I learn, or some things I run into. However, it's very, very important to acknowledge that I'm basically a script kiddie that can do some good tricks. I'm not an expert by any means. Anyway, thanks for reading, if you're up for reading more stuff in the future, stay tuned!
