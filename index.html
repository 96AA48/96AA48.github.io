            <p>
                I'm a 16-year old web developer based in Groningen, The Netherlands.<br>
                I make stuff with my keyboard such as websites as well as server- and client-side applications.<br>
                Unfortunately I currently do this as a hobby and a pasttime, so there is no way to hire me.<br>
                However, I do spend time on Github doing open-source things.
            </p>

            <h4>Here's some things that I made :</h4>

                <p class="right">Dropzone is a small peer-to-peer file sharing application.<br>You basically host your own files, so there is no need for uploading</p>

                    I've always been a fan of Grooveshark.<br>That's why I created Funkshark, a small application that let's you download your favorite songs right off of Grooveshark!
