                    Hey there, you found the place on the internet that is suppose to represent me in personality and expertise.  While being horribly bad at writing introductionary texts for portfolio sites, I am proefficient in the making of loads of HTML, CSS and Javascript-y things like websites, blogs, fullstack webapplications, scripts, desktop applications and games. 
                    <br>Please, feel free to check out the rest of my portfolio!

                            Ever wanted to just quickly listen to that one song without too much hastle, right from the commandline?
                            Well, yplayer has got you covered. It's a small CLI script written with Node.js to quickly list, download and play music from one of the largest databases of music on this planet: YouTube. Just install via npm, insert your YouTube API Datakey and type "yplayer -s &lt;your song&gt;". It's that easy.

                            Another one of my most polished projects. Dropzone is a small desktop application that hosts your files without a third-party with theoratical unlimited download speed. Just drag-and-drop your files directly into the app window and it will be instantly online. The app takes care of the hosting, port forwarding and streaming.<br><br>The files that are being shared can be previewed on a web frontend by the downloaders. Large media files like homemovies, music or cool gameclips can be instantly streamed through the webinterface as well.

                            <a href="http://werkmanrooster.nl">Live</a> on a domain with a different name, rooster.io is a webfrontend for delivering schedules for the students and teachers of Werkman College Stadslyceum. What started as a small project from a couple of students years ago, has grown into the most used schedule site by students. This is my implementation of it.<br><br>
                            This is the project I've spent my most time on during my highschool years. It's a simple database-driven web application that uses Express.js for the frontend, MongoDB or NeDB for the database, Jade for templating, LESS for style templating and my own authentication code.
